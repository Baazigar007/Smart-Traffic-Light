# Smart-Traffic-Light

## What is the Problem ??

    With increasing urban population and hence the number of vehicles, need of controlling streets, highways and roads is
    major issue. One of the main reasons behind todayâ€™s traffic problem are the techniques that are used for traffic
    management. It has no emphasis on live traffic scenario, thus leading to inefficient traffic management systems.
    These traffic timers just show the preset time.
    
    If the traffic light timers are showing correct time to regulate the traffic, then the time wasted on unwanted green
    signals will be saved. Timer for every lane is the simplest way to control traffic. 
    And if those timers are predicting exact time then automatically the system will be more efficient.

    The most appropriate solution to the Congestion problem is letting the congested sides cross the intersection first.
    
    The above proposed solution can be implemented using **OpenCv** library in Python or Machine Learning via 
    Object Detection to count the number of cars in an image and also differentiate between the different types of vehicles.
    
### OpenCv Approach 
    Placing a Camera on each side of the intersection and Processing the images to get the number of vehicles 
    on each side of the intersection .
    
    The Image taken is processed :
    1. Read using OpenCv Library in Python
    2. resized according to need
    3. Converted to Black and White 
    4. Removing Gaussian Noise
    5. Removing Salt and Pepper Noise 
    6. Dilation
    7. Take Difference from reference image 
    8. Find the percentage change 
    9. Get Number of Cars

### Machine Learning Approach 
    
    Capturing an image of each side of the intersection and passing it to the object detection module to get the 
    number of different vehicles on different sides of the intersection.
    
    The Image taken is :
    1. Preprocessed to determine its path
    2. Either a Model is inherited or New one is made to detect cars and different vehicles
    3. Image is loaded and all the detections are saved and lated analysed 
    4. Cars are counted in the Detections
